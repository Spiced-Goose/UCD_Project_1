**Question 1:  Faulty Firewall**

Suppose you have a firewall that's supposed to block SSH connections, but instead lets them through. How would you debug it?

Make sure each section of your response answers the questions laid out below.
​
1. Restate the Problem
  If the problem appears as it has been described, it seems the firewall is letting SSH connections through the firewall, even though it should be blocking them.
2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario
    - In Project 1, did you allow SSH traffic to all of the VMs on your network?
        Yes. I allowed SSH traffic because it was the best way to securly communicate with the VMs. 
    - Which VMs did accept SSH connections?
        The JumpBox, Web-1, and Web-2.
    - What happens if you try to connect to a VM that does not accept SSH connections? Why?
        The connection would be refused. The firewall would filter out the blacklisted connection and deny entry to the machine.

3. Explain the Solution Requirements
    - If one of your Project 1 VMs accepted SSH connections, what would you assume the source of the error is?
        Assuming it was not supposed to be accepting SSH connections, I would assume the issue stemmed from a misconfigured network security rule. 
    - Which general configurations would you double-check?
        I would double check that the SSH Deny rule was actually set to deny, and had not been configured to allow instead. 
        I would also check the Default Deny rule to make sure it was actually denying all traffic and not accepting anything else.
        Lastly, I would check to see if my IP had been whitelisted, as that might allow it through the firewall even if it had been configured to deny. 
    - What actions would you take to test that your new configurations are effective?
        I would attempt to recconect to the VM via SSH after changing/adding rules to deny it. 


4. Explain the Solution Details
    - Which specific panes in the Azure UI would you look at to investigate the problem?
        Network Security Groups
    - Which specific configurations and controls would you check?
        Deny_SSH, or whatever the rule had been named, and Default_Deny. 
    - What would you look for, specifically?
        I would look for a deny rule that had been set to allow rather than deny.
    - How would you attempt to connect to your VMs to test that your fix is effective?
        SSH from another VM or from my personal machine.

5. Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution

    - Does your solution guarantee that the Project 1 network is now "immune" to all unauthorized access?
        Definitely not.
        
    - What monitoring controls might you add to ensure that you identify any suspicious authentication attempts?
        A listener/IDS/IPS to observe/prevent fic that passes through that may be malicious.
